Book 1 - Abstractions, Generalizations, and Basic Physics

Part 1 - Redefining Standard Rules and Style

The describe what's on scenery supporters in room descriptions rule is not listed in any rulebook.

[To use these in text, include html-style tags within the text with square brackets: [i]italic type[/i], [b]bold type[/b]]

To say i -- beginning say_i -- running on: (- style underline; -).
To say /i -- ending say_i -- running on: (- style roman; -).
To say b -- beginning say_b -- running on: (- style bold; -).
To say /b -- ending say_b -- running on: (- style roman; -).

To say br: say line break; [use "[br]"]

Before printing the name of something while listing contents:
	if the holder of the noun contains exactly 1 thing, say "single ".

Before printing the name of a lit thing (called the item) while taking inventory in the dark:
	if the item is bright, say "shining ";
	if the item is dim, say "glowing ";

[cf examples 60 and 330 for possible alternatives to this rule]
Rule for printing a number of something (called the item):
	if the listing group size is 2, say "a couple [printed plural name of item]";
	if the listing group size is at least 3 and the listing group size is at most 5, say "a few [printed plural name of item]";
	if the listing group size is at least 6 and the listing group size is at most 8, say "several [printed plural name of item]";
	if the listing group size is at least 9, say "many [printed plural name of item]".

Part 2 - Space, Time, Physics

The time of day is 01:00 AM.
[invoke during game text using "[time of day as 24h time]"]
To say (relevant time - a time) as 24h time:
	let H be the hours part of relevant time;
	let M be the minutes part of relevant time;
	say "[if H is less than 10]0[end if][H]:[if M is less than 10]0[end if][M]".

Definition: a number is round if the remainder after dividing it by 10 is 0.
Definition: a supporter is occupied rather than empty if something is on it.
Definition: a container is occupied rather than empty if something is in it.

A thing can be notable or mundane. A thing is usually mundane.

Definition: a thing is miniscule if its bulk is 0.
Definition: a thing is tiny if its bulk is 1.
Definition: a thing is small if its bulk is at least 2 and its bulk is at most 4.
Definition: a thing is midsized if its bulk is at least 5 and its bulk is at most 9.
Definition: a thing is large if its bulk is at least 10.

Color is a kind of value. The colors are translucent, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, grey, silver, pink, white, and black. A thing has color. A thing is usually silver. Understand the color property as describing a thing.

[rain suggested trapping the putting X in/taking X out events to change the color accordingly, wouldn't work for initial setup]
[To say the color of (item - a translucent thing):
	if the item encloses something:
		let bleen be the color of a random thing enclosed by the item;
		say "[bleen]";
	otherwise:
		say "transparent";]

A room is usually dark.

Neighboring relates rooms to each other.
The verb to abut (he abuts, they abut, he abutted, it is abutted, he is abutting) implies the neighboring relation.

The verb to be next to implies the neighboring relation.

Definition: a thing is immediate if it is in the location.
Definition: a thing (called the item) is nearby if the location of the item is next to the location of the player.
Definition: a thing is proximate:
	if it is immediate, yes;
	if it is nearby, yes;
	no;

A thing can be hot or cold. A thing is usually cold.

A room can be watery or dry. A room is usually dry.

To decide if the player is underwater:

	now the right hand status line is "[time of day as 24h time]";

To beep:
	say "Beep!"

Book 2 - Let There Be Light

Part 1 - Units and Definitions

Every room has some text called the dark-description. The dark-description is usually "(dark desc is empty)[br][description][br]"

Every thing has some text called the dark-description. The dark-description is usually "(dark desc is empty)[br][description][br]"

A thing can be bright or dim. A thing is usually dim. [how much light?]
A thing can be diffuse or direct. A thing is usually diffuse. [is it a flashlight or a lantern?]
A thing can be infrared. [this is a flag to allow unlit things to be visible in the dark regardless of actual light level]

[A container can be translucent. [this will allow light to travel into a container from the parent room, but prevent visibility otherwise(as soon as i get around to writing that part)]]

Definition: a thing is shining if it is lit and it is bright.
Definition: a thing is glowing if it is lit and it is dim.

Definition: a room is bright if it encloses a shining thing.
Definition: a room is dim:
	if it encloses a glowing thing and it does not enclose a shining thing, yes;

[these are meant to be on-the-fly calculations and the actual lighted/dark status of a room should probably not be relied upon as a measurement as it will change during play]
[these don't account for shining things being inside opaque containers right now]
To decide if the light level is bright:
	if the location encloses a shining thing, yes;
	no.
	
To decide if the light level is dim:
	if the location encloses a lit thing (called the luminant):
		if the luminant is shining, no;
		otherwise yes;
	no.

To decide if the light level is murky:
	if the location does not enclose a lit thing, yes;
	no.

Part 2 - New Rules

The can't act in the dark rule is not listed in any rulebook.
The first visibility rule:
	consider the new-visibility rulebook instead.

The new-visibility rules is a rulebook. The new-visibility rules have outcomes there is sufficient light (failure), there is mediocre light (failure), and there is insufficient light (success).

["There is sufficient light" and "There is mediocre light" are functionally the same, so the only way to tell the difference between the two is to trap the exceptions appropriately]
A new-visibility rule (this is the visibility level rule):
	if the light level is bright:
		there is sufficient light; [being in a bright room always passes all vis checks]
	otherwise if the actor is carrying a bright direct thing:
		there is sufficient light; [so does having a flashlight in hand]
	otherwise if the actor is carrying a dim direct thing:
		there is mediocre light; [but if the flashlight is getting weak...]
	otherwise if the light level is dim:
		if the noun is familiar, there is sufficient light; [we'll make an exception if the player has examined it before]
		otherwise there is mediocre light;
	otherwise if the noun is infrared:
		there is sufficient light; [make an exception for anything else flagged infrared]
	otherwise:
		there is insufficient light. [if none of the above is true, the player is probably in the dark]

[The shining-glowing exception causes a dark room to become lit if the room contains lit things, so by definition a dark room is one that does not contain any lit things, and thus nothing should be in scope. An exception might be made for familiar things the player has dropped; need to do more work]

[This rule is here to further assist the stock light adjustments conform to the new definitions:
If a room contains lit objects, AND is dark, it should be made lighted
If a room has no lit objects inside it, AND it is lighted, it should be made dark
A room can be forced to be lit by the use of a privately-named scenery object if needed
The initial "X is lighted/dark" statements should ONLY be used to set the initial lighting state of a given room]
The supplementary light adjustment rule is listed after the adjust light rule in the turn sequence rulebook.
This is the supplementary light adjustment rule:
	if the location is dark:
		if the light level is bright or the light level is dim:
			now the location is lighted;
	otherwise:
		if the light level is murky:
			now the location is dark.

Part 3 - New Activities

[Emma knows where is in the ship by memory anyway, so don't bother obscuring the names of rooms]
Rule for printing the name of a room (called the place) (this is the new room-name rule):
	[only certain actions and activities should get the full light treatment, everything else just gets the room]
	let light-description-toggle be false;
	if the current action is looking, now light-description-toggle is true;
	[if the player is in Dreamspace, now light-description-toggle is false;]
	if the printing the announcement of light activity is going on, say "..." instead; [if the look action was automatically generated, we're going to skip announcing the name of the room again for now; would be a good place to insert a message later]
	if light-description-toggle is false, say "[printed name of the place]" instead;
	if the light level is murky:
		say "[printed name of the place], in the [random dark-noun]" instead;
	if the light level is dim:
		say "[printed name of the place], in dim light" instead;
	if the light level is bright:
		say "[printed name of the place], in the [random light-noun]" instead;
	say "[printed name of the place]" instead.

Rule for printing the name of a dark room:
	follow the new room-name rule for the location instead;

Rule for printing the description of a dark room:
	say "[dark-description of the location]"; [must explicitly define a room because otherwise I7 will try to use the nonexistent "outside" as the room referred to]

[With regards to location contents listing after a dark room's description:
Because a dark room is defined as one that does not contain any lit things, it is thus impossible to see anything in the room. Again, an exception might be made for familiar things the player has abandoned here]

[since Emma knows where she is even in the dark, we want the rooms she arrives in to be visited as normal]
The replacement arrival check rule is listed instead of the check new arrival rule in the carry out looking rules.
This is the replacement arrival check rule:
	if the location is a room, now the location is visited;
	if in darkness:
		now the darkness witnessed is true;
		
[Changes the "You also see..." message written during room description to be a little more flexible]
Rule for listing nondescript items while the light level is dim (this is the illumination rule):
	let foo be a random number from 1 to 2;
	if foo is:
		-- 1: say "The [random lit visible thing] [random light-verb] "; [The glowing blorb shines on a sprocket.]
		-- 2: say "The [color of random lit visible thing] [random light-noun] from [a random lit visible thing] [random light-verb] "; [The shifting light from the glowing blorb illuminates a sprocket.]
	list the contents of the location, as a sentence, listing marked items only;
	say ".";

Part 1 - Platonic Solids

Chapter 1 - Doors

A door usually has bulk 20.

Chapter 2 - Containers

The container interior rule is listed before the room description body text rule in the carry out looking rules. 

This is the container interior rule:
	if the actor is the player and the player is in an enterable thing (called current cage), say the inside-description of the current cage.

A container has some text called the inside-description. The inside-description is usually "How'd you get in here?" 

Before entering an enterable thing (called the cage):
	if the cage is closed, try opening the cage;

Before exiting:
	if the actor is inside a container, try opening the container exited from;

Deck A is a region.

Part 1 - The Autodoc

The Autodoc is a room. "You're lying down inside a metal coffin that isn't much larger than you. It (you?) reeks of medical disinfectants; the fuzziness in your head feels like it's keeping away a headache from all the fumes."
The printed name of the autodoc is "Antiseptic Coffin". Understand "coffin" as the Autodoc. The dark-description of the Autodoc is "It's cold and damp and dark in here."
The Autodoc is in Deck A.

The unlock button is a pushbutton. The unlock button is part of the control panel.
Check pushing the unlock button:
	if the control panel is active:
		say "ERROR: Completion of surgery cycle has not been confirmed." instead;
	if the autodoc door is unlocked:
		say "ERROR: Autodoc hatch is not sealed." instead;

Carry out pushing the unlock button:
	now the autodoc door is unlocked;
	now the exit button is flashing;

Report pushing the unlock button:
	say "The button flashes a couple times; there is a metallic [i]click[/i] as the locks disengage." instead;

The exit button is a pushbutton. The exit button is part of the control panel.
Check pushing the exit button:
	if the autodoc door is locked:
		if the control panel is active:
			say "ERROR: Completion of surgery cycle has not been confirmed." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "ERROR: [printed name of autodoc's hatch] is locked." instead;

Carry out pushing the exit button:
	now the autodoc door is open;
	now the exit button is steady;

Report pushing the exit button:
	say "A beat passes, and then the hatch seal on the [printed name] disengages with a whoosh of pressurized air. The stench of old blood quickly replaces the tang of disinfectants." instead;

A door called the autodoc door is outside of the Autodoc and inside of the Medical Bay. "[if player is in Autodoc]A small plastex [printed name of hatch window] is set into the hatch above you.[else]The dark hulk of the autodoc crouches in one corner." It is locked. The printed name of the Autodoc's hatch is "hatch". The description of the autodoc's hatch is "The door of the coffin. There is a tiny plastex window the size of a playing card directly in front of your head, and a control panel a few inches below that."

	try pushing the exit button instead;

Report closing the autodoc door:
	say "There is a hiss of air as the hatch seals pressurize." instead;

Report going through the autodoc door to the Medical Bay during Autodoc Escape:
	say "You sit up, lift open the hatch with one shoulder, and roll over the lip of the autodoc. The fall to the ground is thankfully short.";

The hatch window is part of the autodoc door. The description of the hatch window is "The frosted plastex shows only flickers of dim light on the ceiling above." 

Part 2 - The Medical Bay

The Medical Bay is a room. The Medical Bay is in Deck A. The Medical Bay is dark.
"[first time]You make a [i]splash[/i] instead of a [i]thud[/i] when you land. As you raise your {{drug-addled}} head to look, you choke down the urge to vomit as you realize the syrupy black gunk coating your arms up to the bicep is half-dried blood. The puddle is almost ankle-deep and wall-to-wall.[br][br][only]
{{'Disarray' is putting it mildly:}} every single cabinet in the room is open and empty. Some of the doors have been torn off the hinges and lie mangled in a corner. The grey tile floor is littered with broken glass, bits of medical paraphernalia, and dried blood."

A container called a chemical shower is here. The shower is [transparent, ]openable, enterable, and closed.
"A green vinyl curtain is drawn across the entrance to a small chemical shower."
The description is "The humble chemical shower is equipped with a variety of {{anti-chemical chemicals}} and its own fluid reclamation system. [br][br]A green vinyl curtain[if the shower is open] hangs to one side.[else] is drawn across the entrance."
The inside-description is "The extruded fiberglass walls are only just wide enough apart to let you in. A spigot overhead must be where the {{soapy water}} comes out; a drain underfoot must be where it goes. [br][br]A green vinyl curtain[if the shower is open] hangs to one side.[else] is drawn across the entrance."
[the room description should appear slightly shrouded when the curtain is closed]

Does the player mean entering the shower: it is likely.

Check taking the shower:
	try pushing the shower cycle button instead;

Report opening the shower: say "The plastic rustles as you push the curtain aside." instead;

Report closing the shower: say "You tug the curtain across the entrance." instead; 

A vinyl curtain is part of the chemical shower. The curtain is green and scenery.

A lightsource called a chemical lamp is inside the shower. The lamp is yellow and scenery.
The description is "A simple chemical light is glued to the roof of the shower. They say these are supposed to be good for a couple centuries; you suppose this one has at least another century and nine-tenths to go before it burns out."

Instead of switching off the chemical lamp: say "It can't be switched off."

A showerhead is inside the shower. The showerhead is scenery. The description is "A metal shower head. It hangs directly above, and appears to thread onto a pipe."

A drainspout is inside the shower. The drainspout is scenery. The description is "An eight-inch round metal grate has been set into the floor."

A pushbutton called the shower cycle button is inside the chemical shower. The printed name is "cycle button". "The only controls in here are a fist-sized button labeled 'PUSH' in big block letters." The description is "A single black rubberized button, large enough to hit blindly in a panic if need be.[first time][br]A lightning-flash of memory: eyes burning pain eating around eye sockets like the devil's fingers scooping the -[br]You stifle that thought even as remembering it triggers a quick squirt of adrenaline like a cold hand trailing down your spine.[only]"

Check pushing the shower cycle button:
	if Drain The Blood has not ended:
		say "You can practically feel that shower already, but the slick wall-to-wall scarlet pool on the floor stays your hand. No matter how clean you get, stepping back into that murk is going to make you just as dirty as before." instead;

Carry out pushing the shower cycle button:
	now the chemical shower is closed;
	now the player is clean;

Report pushing the shower cycle button:
	say "You [if the shower is open]pull the curtain closed and [end if]slap the cycle activation button. The warm water on your corpse-chilled flesh stings at first, but a moment or two later and it's the best thing you can remember feeling in a long time.[br]The water stops, and you realize you haven't actually scrubbed down. You hit the cycle button again (tamping down a brief pang of guilt - 'Water is liquid gold aboard a starship!') and use the little plastic scrubber to get all the nooks and crannies.[br][i]Much[/i], much better." instead;

A container called some lockers is here. The lockers are open and not openable.
"A bank of gear lockers along one wall have received a similar treatment as the cabinets."
The description is "The crew lockers are busted to hell, though they're usually empty anyway. They're only meant as temporary storage, until the assigned crewman gets back on their feet[first time].[br][br]The locker on the far end appears to be intact: the lock panel on its face glows red[only]."

After examining some lockers for the first time:
	now the personal locker is not scenery;
	now some lockers are scenery;

Instead of inserting something into some lockers: say "None of the [if personal locker is familiar]other [end if]lockers look like they will support weight."

Does the player mean doing something with some lockers: it is unlikely.

A container called the personal locker is here. The personal locker is locked and fixed in place. The color of the personal locker is red.
"One of the gear lockers is still intact; the controls glow [color of combo lock]."
The description is "The nameplate reads 'E. Lumien'. It looks like it's [if unlocked]un[end if]locked."

After examining the personal locker for the first time:
	now the initial appearance of the personal locker is "Your gear locker sits at the end of the row, controls glowing [color of personal locker]."

Understand "far/my locker" as the personal locker.

A dial called the combo lock is part of the personal locker. The combo lock is red.
The description is "The locker will open provided you enter the correct 4-digit PIN. The lock is currently [color of combo lock]: the locker is [if personal locker is unlocked]un[end if]locked."

After setting the combo lock to "4444":
	now the personal locker is unlocked;
	now the personal locker is open;
	now the color of the personal locker is green;
	now the color of the combo lock is green;
	say "The locker door pops open.";

After closing the personal locker:
	now the personal locker is locked;
	now the color of the personal locker is green;
	now the color of the combo lock is red;
	say "There is a [i]click[/i] as the lock engages. The readout blurs from green to red.";

A jumpsuit is inside the personal locker. The jumpsuit is wearable and indigo. "A clean and folded jumpsuit rests on the shelf of the locker." The description is "It's a standard crew shipsuit, colored indigo, with the Starlight Dancer's black-and-gold insignia on the left shoulder."  

A remedy called a bandage is inside the personal locker. "A sterile adhesive bandage, still in its wrapper, lies on the shelf of the locker." The description is "An adhesive bandage. It's basically an extra-big bandaid; the long adhesive strips let you get it on practically anywhere you need it."

[Insert a rule here to override the usual error checking if the bandage is worn/applied to a specific limb]

Check an actor wearing something(this is the clean clothing rule):
	if the actor is dirty, say "You're too dirty to put that on. You'll need to get cleaned off first." instead;

A pile of mangled junk is here. The junk is fixed in place.
"A giant pile of debris lies more or less in the corner."
The description is "Most of it looks to be wreckage from whatever went berserk in here[first time]. Strangely, all of it's been piled up here in the corner[only]."
Understand "debris" as the junk.

A piece of scrap is in the pile of junk. "This is the init app of the piece of scrap."
The description is "A piece of flat metal shaped something like a capital J. The curved end has a rather pointy tip."

Report the player taking the piece of scrap:
	say "You find and take a handy-looking bit of metal[if the drain is familiar]. This should be just the thing to unclog that drain with[end if]." instead;

After examining the pile of junk:
	if the drain is familiar and the pile of junk is occupied:
		try the player taking the piece of scrap;
		
A pool of blood is here. The blood is fixed in place.
"The floor is ankle-deep in blood. It gurgles and sloshes as you move about. You try not to move around too much."
The description is "The emergency lighting makes it look near-black, with a monochrome-red sheen almost like machine oil. You'd prefer the smell of machine oil over this organic reek, come to that."

After examining the pool of blood for the first time:
	say "You can't see a drain through the murky surface, but if you had to guess it'd be right about in the middle of the floor. You'll have to search for it a bit though."

Instead of searching the blood:
	move the drain to the Medical Bay;
	now the drain is familiar;
	say "You take a breath and hold it before plunging both hands into the murk and feeling your way across the floor. The drain is (fortunately) right where you expected. However, your hand grazes something obscenely organic clogging the drainspout, slick and coarse and squelchy-wet. The sensation makes you recoil in disgust; you slip an inch or two on the tile and almost go over into the ichor.[br]"
	
There is a closed locked container called a drain. The drain is fixed in place.
"[if the pool of blood is not in the drain]A clogged drain lies under the rippling surface of the pool.[else]A steel mesh drain has been set into the middle of the tile floor."
The description is "[if the drain is locked]You gingerly reach out and touch the drain, trying not to brush up against that disgusting clog too much. [end if]The drain is about six inches across and made of punched steel; they're a standard fixture on all starships."
The matching key of the drain is the piece of scrap.

Understand "unclog [something] with [something]" as unlocking it with.

Does the player mean unlocking the drain with the piece of scrap: it is very likely.
[Does the player mean unlocking the drain with right hand: it is likely.]

Check unlocking the drain with something (called the drainsnake):
	if the drainsnake is not the piece of scrap:
		say "Even if you were willing to tear that clog out by hand - the mere thought sends a frisson of disgust up your spine - you doubt you could. You'll need some kind of a hook or tool to unclog the drain." instead;

After unlocking the drain with the piece of scrap:
	move the pool of blood to the drain;
	say "You use the hook-shaped scrap to tug the clog out, splashing more filth up your arms and chest. The pool of blood gurgles as it whirls down the drain.";

[perhaps fix the action-on-drain issue by putting it into scope when applicable? would probably suit the inform outlook better]
[when the blood is drained out, it's vented directly into space? since it's waste anyway? maybe into water reclamation (taking dropped things with it)?]
[what to do with that disgusting piece of scrap now?]

A mysterious corpse is here.
"Against the wall, tucked fetal into the corner, lies a corpse wearing a shipsuit. If it weren't for the shipsuit, you'd never know it was a corpse in the first place."

A lightsource called an emergency lightstrip is here. It is red, infrared, scenery, lit, and switched on.
The description is "A series of cheap lights have been sunk into a chunk of red plastex about three feet long. The matte surface keeps the scarlet light from being harsh. Three of them are spaced across the ceiling."

A door called the medbay door is west of Hallway A and east of the Medical Bay. It is locked and unopenable.
The description is "The door out of the Medical Bay is coated with the same dried blood as everything else in the room. The lights on the control panel glow [color of medbay-door panel]."

A panel called the medbay-door panel is part of the medbay door. It is red.

Part 3 - Hallway A

Hallway A is a room. "Hallway!" Hallway A is in Deck A.

[Once Deck A is set up, use the neighboring relation to establish the correct adjacency of rooms for the listening logic, repeat for each deck]

	wait for any key;
	say "[br]Nothing does, so far as anyone knows. And these other jokers, they had [i]successful[/i] missions, or even just break-even missions. Their dreams are a little weird, otherwise pleasant or at worst harmless.";

	say "[br]I'm the only one with a void file, the only one who came back from the Starlight Dancer. My dreams are blackest cold, the chill the sinners lying under Cocytus must feel at night.

A badly-milled bolt opens a bloody streak on the back of your wrist, and several seconds pass before you realize you can't feel it because you're completely numb.[br]
	...[br]
	The smoke smell drifts by your nose again, a little stronger. You startle and bark your forehead on the plastex window above you. The pain keeps you awake this time.";

		You shiver and slap your forearms, trying to keep blood circulating through your hands.[or]
		A coil of stench unwinds into your nostrils: you gag and fight back the dry heaves.[or]
