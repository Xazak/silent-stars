> [W-MedBay] door controls broken
  + Planq, jumpsuit, earlight
  = autodoc, gear locker
  ! email:maryam/re:autodoc
  > Exit autodoc
  > Open locker (takes RECALL COMBO)
  > Exit Medbay (takes planq override)

(Hallway A: [N-Astro], W-Medbay, E-SciLabs, [SE-ElevA:v], SW-LifeS)

> E-SciLabs
  + Cutter, technical manuals, memory chip
  = SciLab terminal
  > Download tech manuals, logfiles
  > Upgrade planq.security (takes memory chip)
  > Hack into sci.term
	> Examine hidden datacache
 
> [N-Astro] Door ctrls broken
  = Locked door, Astro terminal, viewports
  > Hack into astro.term
  	> Change viewport configuration

> [SE-ElevA] Locked by puzzle; requires cutter (in SciLabs)
  = Broken door, access panel to crawlspace
  IF door.bolts are CUT: irreversible, door is openable NOT lockable
  IF access.bolts are CUT: reversible w/ welder AND $resource
  IF door.mechanism is CUT: door forced open, reparable w/ $resource

> SE-ElevA

> [NW-CpnQr] locked by SecCm(top.security)

> [NE-XOQtr] locked by pressure diff; reports as normal on LifeS
  > pressurizing room will unlock door, but the atmo used cannot be retrieved because it is vented into space
  > better option is to locate EVA gear first before attempting to enter
  + Maryam's journal

  + (things left behind by Amaranthe and Tristan)
  = the void of space, crash webbing
  ! Access only possible when:
  	> Player wearing valid EVA gear
	> Pressure differential released

> [S-SecCm] locked by SecCm(top.security)/locked by LifeS(hull.breach)
  = AURITA's AI core
  ! No hull breach exists, error faked to prevent door opening
  ! Truth of errors ascertained after reprogramming LMR for recon

> N-RecRm (cryo??)
  + ? (holotapes?)
  = ElevB, viewscreen, RecRm terminal, (galley and dining rms)

> Machine Shop
  = Major equipment for metalwork

> Fuel A
  
> Fuel B

> Engine Pit
> ElevA
> EVA Garage
 <player can end game any point after taking EVA mask!>
 <ship drift is now in hazardous range! danger!>
 <enough time allowance is made re: engine repairs>

> Thrusters (If player chooses to investigate...)
> Crew B
> XO Qtr
 <game should end before this point if drift not corrected>
 <if not corrected, travel is very dangerous in meantime>

> Bridge
> Cargo | Cpn Qtr | SecCm | S.Cargo
 <shards can be resolved with findings now accessible>
 <AURITA's motive can then be resolved one way or another>
 <only remaining goal is to escape>
