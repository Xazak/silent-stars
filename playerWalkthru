> SE-ElevA

> [NW-CpnQr] locked by SecCm(top.security)

> [NE-XOQtr] locked by pressure diff; reports as normal on LifeS
  > pressurizing room will unlock door, but the atmo used cannot be retrieved because it is vented into space

  	> Player wearing valid EVA gear
	> Pressure differential released

> [S-SecCm] locked by SecCm(top.security)/locked by LifeS(hull.breach)
  = AURITA's AI core
  ! No hull breach exists, error faked to prevent door opening
  ! Truth of errors ascertained after reprogramming LMR for recon

> N-RecRm
  + ? (holotapes?)
