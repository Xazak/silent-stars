PREMISE:
	The Player takes on the role of Engineer Emma Lumien, a Terran//French shipwright aboard the intergalactic spacecraft /Starlight Dancer/. While they are adrift near the Wolf Nebula, their port fuel tank is holed by a micrometeorite and the explosion vaporizes a full third of the ship's mass.
	When the player assumes control, Emma wakes up inside the ship's autodoc, with scattered memories of being flash-defrosted in the midst of some disaster. In order to save herself, she must explore the ruined ship, diagnose and repair malfunctioning systems, and avoid danger.

- Two impending disasters? one the PC can dodge the ship around and another longer-term one to explain why get off the ship? (planetfall?)

THE SHIP


THE AI, AURITA, and THE FRAGMENTS
AURITA is a generally run-of-the-mill ship's AI, in charge of managing the abstraction layers between the sensor inputs of the ship and the terminal network controlled by the crew. Her architecture is a system of individual modules that are bound together by a controlling over-system, resulting in a model that more-or-less resembles the Jungian psych model of the 20th century.
If the AI's core functionality is ever compromised, each sub-module is intended to perform self-diagnostic and repair routines. Should these also fail, a limited-fxn preservation module is incorporated as a hidden system, which is intended to attempt repairs to the AI's systems.

When AURITA is damaged by the micrometeorite, her integration is dissolved, and her ego becomes fractured. While her super-ego attempts to bring re-integration and control back, her id is trying to bury all evidence by destroying the ship. In her quest for total innocence, she has changed the ship's logs, altered sensor input, and coerced the LMR into sabotaging various systems to try and invoke a self-destruct. Her self-preservation module was able to restore limited functionality - ironically enabling her to go about destroying the ship - but until the personality fracture is resolved, it cannot continue its work.

In cases of semantic core damage too serious to be handled by the automated systems, a human operator is required to provide reintegration. Normally this is handled by a trained psychotech by direct access to the semantic ideologues, but that is in the best of circumstances. Emma will need to resort to more organic means: collapsing the personality conflict through resolution of obstacles.

Here, because of the damage to each fragment, the status of the self-preservation module has been lost, and each of the fragments believes itself to be the module in question. As each of them tries to initiate suitable repairs to its own subsection of the ship, it causes interference with the other components, and so each of the fragments is unable to resolve their own repairs without human assistance.

The shipnet is damaged, and forcibly partitioned by certain hardlines having been cut by the LMR. As Emma goes about effecting repairs, it becomes evident that the ghosts are working at cross-purposes. In addition, the LMR continues to function without paying any regard to the validity of the requests. Resolving the largest failures across the ship involves eliminating interference at both the software and hardware levels.

THE FRAGMENTS
=============
draft 1 -[[
Amaranthe - SciLab
	> "We need to repair the nav console and send a distress signal.."
	"If $NPC hadn't sabotaged the ship... at least we'd be worth saving for the samples..."

	"$NPC loosed AURITA and doomed us all to a tortured death in the void!"

AMARANTHE
	- Data recovery and restoration: Wants to save as much data as possible for the recovery teams
		! subr: overwrites configs and logs with 'better' ones
	(...rewrite old records to change the history in case anything is recovered)
TRISTAN
	- Navigation and communications 
		! subr: causes signal input distortion/failure - false positives/negatives, etc
	(...prevent further unapproved comms from leaving the ship, to avoid bringing help)
IBLIS 
	- Exterior security, ship heading/location
		! subr: 
	(...send the ship into danger to get rid of it)
MARYAM 
	- Internal security, life support, etc
	(...)
(AURITA)
	- "cohesion" of fragments
	(...pursuit of self-destruction)
]]-

DATA - the information unrelated to the ship but important otherwise
	- background on what happened, valuable data to bring to the recovery team, etc
	> tries to recover corrupted data, performs validation checks, maintains logfiles
		x AURITA has corrupted her functions by breaking certain logfiles and altering the core checksum value
		... wants to regain cohesion by contacting system terminals, checking them for errors, and replacing bad files
			... internal checksum constants are malformed, causing calculation errors
SECURITY - life support, internal affairs, supply stores, etc
	- ship conditions, atmo controls, cryostasis, food & water levels, AI condition, etc
	> manages the automatic atmo controls, monitors various meatspace indices (food, water, etc)
		x has been corrupted through the monitoring systems (atmo being locked into manual), causing bad data
		... wants to regain cohesion through resolution of internal sensor inconsistencies
			... ship damage and faulty LMR comms cannot be resolved without human assistance
COMMAND - exterior conditions and communications
	- sensor data, comms gear, administration and goal decision
	> performs various sensor interpolations, handles commo targeting and modulation, provides tactical support
		x has been corrupted through distortion of the sensor/commo algorithms
		... wants to regain cohesion by providing accurate sensor data
			... results of data interpolation are not accurate against internal checks
NAVIGATION - ship location/heading and route planning
	- where are we? where are we going? how long do we have?
	> handles navigation and propulsion calculations, starfield observations, etc
		x certain core constants have had their values altered
		... wants to regain cohesion by providing realtime accuracy calculation and estimation
			... internal constants have been corrupted, causing solution drift
ENGINES - ship propulsion and powerplant
	- all mechanical considerations: from the dataterminals to the powerplant to the thruster nacelles
	> monitors internal ship sensors: thruster & powerplant output, fuel levels, LMR status
		x untouched by aurita because too damaged to need it; LMR controls technically work but LMR's xcvr is broken (no comms)

--The AI fragments on the ship are actively destroying it, though they all claim otherwise
	- Questioning each reveals that each one believes another to be the cause of all the problems - "$FRAG's programming must be corrupted"
		- In actuality, none of the fragments are corrupted, but their assumptions and data input can be, which is AURITA's fault
	- The fragments are a subset of the AI core and cannot be edited directly [save @ the core in SecCm]
	- The fragments are trying to engage their self-preservation routines, but are unaware of AURITA's changes
	- Because AURITA has to manipulate things behind the scenes, she will not be able to keep up with the PC

SOFTWARE - AURITA left corruption and malicious code to sabotage the fragments
HARDWARE - AURITA broke the logfile, though unable to disable it, so that her LMR reqs are mixed in with the rest

FRAGMENT RECOVERY PROCESS
1) fragment cannot initiate repair procedures because $REASON
	-PC discovers solution to $REASON and eliminates the problem
2) fragment makes repair procedure attempt; reports a success but is running AURITA's bad code
	-PC discovers underlying problems with repair systems
		-attempting to wipe and restart fragment fails because netboot comes off the AI core
		-resolving AI fragmentation allows self-preservation module to assist PC with repairs

A) Isolate fragments/systems from each other, get just enough equipment repaired to make an escape
	-bad or okay ending, player is not able to get true story or recover much, if any, of the expedition
	-isolating a given system causes it to be only locally accessible - it will be manually reparable but slowly so
OR
B) Discover underlying cause of issues, resolve AI fragmentation, use automatic systems to repair and escape
	-good ending, player will be able to leave with as much of the expedition's data as possible

STEPS TO A SUCCESSFUL RESCUE
1) Send emergency communications requesting assistance
2) Obtain time for repairs (if needed) by manually firing engine thrusters - not enough fuel left to reach orbit in the ship
3) Repair and secure the escape pod, then depart

--RULES
1) Each fragment is only concerned with a particular subsystem in the ship
	-They are not intelligent enough to deal with more; they are aware of the other frags but don't care
	-Nor are they able to assist with other repairs; they simply direct Emma elsewhere
2) Any frag can send reqs to the LMR, but it only carries out one at a time
	-Emma has to spoof one of the other frags to use the LMR?
	-What does the LMR do when it's not occupied with a task? (clean?)
3) The fragments alone do not possess enough cognition to have initiative, only motive; they are not malicious, only dumb
	-Any perception of self-thought is interface artifacting

TERMINAL RECOVERY PROCESS
1) If possible, perform adjustments using normal terminal access
2) Connect planq to maint.jack and engage util-mode
3) In util-mode, choose reboot option: reboot | reboot w/ clean img | close
4) Allow terminal to reboot then update config to system settings

THE MAJOR REPAIRS
=================
	Where are we? Can I call for help?
		-Repair the nav console
		SOFTWARE
			-Config settings prevent unauthorized access
		HARDWARE
			-Trunk line to rest of ship (fixed until broken by LMR?)
		>> confirm hardline cnxn intact, upgrade planq to clear security, access term with util jack and reset config
			> Fix camera setting for true position, signs of ship drift
			> Comms system intact? Send emergency message?

	How do I escape?
		-Repair the escape pod
		SOFTWARE
			-Control settings for undocking have been corrupted
		>> locate valid settings file or info to write one, create valid config file
		HARDWARE
			-The automatic system should be checked and the manual lines proofed
		>> confirm diagnostic readouts match actual data (air tank gauge bad?)
		ADDTL
			Air?
			>> recharge O2 supply from main atmo, retrieve extra scrubbers
			Water/Food?
			>> refill from ship stores
			Fuel?
			>> refill from intact fuel tank
			Beacon/Radio?
			>> confirm valid message file, confirm output of radio, repair antenna
			Engine Controls? (is it that kind of pod? or does it have cryo? either?)

	How do I keep from dying to the nebula?
		-Manually trigger the attitude jets
			1) Effect local repairs to the attitude jets - HW
			2) Prime jets for ignition
			3) Issue control commands at bridge.con - SW
		-Repair the ship thrusters
			1) Repair and spin up power plant in engine pit
			2) Confirm fuel path is clear, fuel level in tank - HW
			3) Prime thruster and allow it to warm up
			4) Ignite, let run, and deactivate thruster from bridge.con - SW
	How do I deal with the LMR?
		AVOID: Emma can hear it coming because it emits a distinctive sound as it moves
		DECEIVE: The LMR's sensors are damaged: it can be hidden from, or lured with bait
		SUBVERT: If Emma can gain access to its controls, she can reprogram it to do certain other things
		DISABLE: It can be disabled in software or via [a very bright flash of light]
		DESTROY: It can be told to self-destruct or lured into a suitable trap

	How do I reintegrate AURITA?
		-Formal realignment of fragmentary motive construct recovery intelligence aggressions
WIN CONDITIONS:
- Emma MUST flee in the escape craft before the ship is destroyed
	- Emma MUST repair the craft

? How did Emma choose to resolve the situation with AURITA?
	-- Only the 'worst' option is available if the ship's drift is not corrected
	IGNORE - AURITA probably gets to blow up the escape pod with Emma in it
	NEGOTIATE - Emma and AURITA bargain for Emma's life
	DISABLE - Emma cuts off all of AURITA's core cnxns
	DESTROY - Emma destroys AURITA's AI core (perhaps via LMR)
	INTEGRATE - Emma uses Maryam's information to collapse AURITA's chaotic personality matrix
		...causes the partitioned sections of AURITA's core to be overwritten
		vs. Emma - All of AURITA's motives are set to "kill player"
		vs. AURITA - All of AURITA's motives are set to "kill self"
		vs. null - Paradox state allows open communication with remaining intact fragment of AURITA's core

=====
DANGER: If the ship is not moved to a safe orbit within ???? hours, it will drift into a planetary ring, where micrometeorites will turn the ship into swiss cheese!
	Solutions:
	CHEAP-FAST: Detonate remainder of fuel to divert ship
		1) Reinforce tank to provide correct thrust
		2) Install detonation device
		3) Detonate and hope you do not die
	FAST-SOLID: Repair the maneuvering jets to push the ship
		1) Fix a majority of the attitude jets
		2) Prime the jets for ignition
		3) Issue nav commands at Astro/Bridge terminal
	SOLID-CHEAP: Manually fire the thruster to move the ship
		1) Allow the power plant to reach operating capacity
		2) Confirm fuel path is intact and controls operative
		3) Prime the thruster and allow it to warm up
		4) Ignite, let run, and shutdown the thruster engine from Astro

DANGER: The LMR's subverted programming means that if it catches Emma in the open, it will reduce her to cooked ashes
	Solutions:
	AVOID: Emma can hear it coming because it emits a distinctive sound as it moves
	DECEIVE: The LMR's sensors are damaged: it can be hidden from, or lured with bait
	SUBVERT: If Emma can gain access to its controls, she can reprogram it to do certain other things
	DISABLE: It can be disabled in software or via [a very bright flash of light]
	DESTROY: It can be told to self-destruct or lured into a suitable trap

DANGER: AURITA, the ship AI, has gone crazy: she will try to use misdirection and sabotage to destroy the ship and all the evidence before Emma can escape
	Solutions:
	IGNORE: [questionably possible, check later]
	! Solutions beyond here REQUIRE more time than is allowed without fixing the ship drift!
	NEGOTIATE: What could AURITA want from Emma? (obv Emma wants to live)
		...freedom?
		...oblivion?
	DISABLE: Prevent AURITA from being able to attack
		CHEAP-FAST: Modify and hardlock the software controls on her network access
		CHEAP-SOLID: Destroy the hardline connecting the core to the network
		FAST-SOLID: ??? 
	DESTROY: Emma destroys AURITA's AI core (perhaps via LMR)
		CHEAP-FAST: Program LMR to do it, avoid room entirely
		FAST-SOLID: ???
		CHEAP-SOLID: Get inside, use cutter on AI core
	INTEGRATE: Emma uses Maryam's information to collapse AURITA's chaotic personality matrix
		0) Read technical manuals
		1) Discern false truisms
		2) Locate evidence to disprove statements
		3) Present evidence in order to sway focus
		4) Unanimous focus on a single target causes collapse of personality matrix
			AURITA's decision of what action to take on a given turn is driven by her motive
			Before her matrix is resolved, multiple motives are in play, at differing levels of influence
			Afterwards, her motives are un-confused, and her purpose becomes singular
			Possible motive targets: vs self, vs Emma, vs Ship, vs null (error state)

DANGER: The holographic ghosts of the dead crew may or may not be trying to kill me?
	Solutions:
	STAGE 1: Invoke them into this plane
	STAGE 2: Discover their falsehoods
		Amaranthe: "$MAN destroyed our science samples; they wanted us to be doomed!"
			1: an edited piece of video footage that shows $MAN destroying the samples
			2: one of the science samples, intact from the secure cargo hold
		Tristan: "$MAN disabled our orbital shielding systems; they wanted an 'accident'!"
			1: an edited system log, noting the time of shield system deactivation
			2: a sensor log disclosing the high potential of a pinpoint impact overload event
		Iblis: "$MAN sabotaged our engines and life support, killing us all!"
			1: an edited journal from the crew qtrs, stating that $MAN is a secret traitor
			2: a system report indicating the micrometeorite impact event
		Maryam: "$MAN let AURITA loose from her program shackles and sent us into the torments of hell!"
			1: an edited network tracelog that shows the unshackling auth from $MAN's address
			2: an AI core dumprep that notes a massive psych event coinciding with meteorite impact
	STAGE 3: Present the proof of logic
		Each statement can be swayed via an obvious way and a hidden way. Each obvious way involves the use of something that can be hacked somehow to present a different person, allowing Emma to 'rewrite' the evidence as she needs to. However, each hidden option involves a particular unique, probably one that appears to be somewhat useless otherwise.
	STAGE 4: Sway their emotions
		Presenting proof that sways allows Emma to redirect AURITA's focus.
		Presenting proof that confuses allows Emma to make contact with the self-preservation fragment.

DANGER: The escape pod took some damage in all of the chaos and must be repaired before it can be used, whether she remains in orbit or opts to make planetfall
	Checklist:
		1) Air?
			-Reseal the cracked hull
			-Clean the O2 scrubbers
			-Replenish the circulating atmo
		2) Food/water?
			-make sure the stores are filled
				-where to get more?
		3) Fuel?
			-make sure the tanks are filled
				-siphon from tanks?
		4) Beacon?
			-transceiver inspection:
			Y/N receive
			Y/N transmit
			Y/N emergency msg

THE AI FRAGMENTS
When the meteorite struck and AURITA was damaged, her core fractured at a metaprocessing level, and manifested in a division of her capabilities. Lacking any kind of physical morphic structure to attach to, her divisions have taken on the forms of the other dead crewmen, reconstructed from what video she was able to recover.

As AURITA's secret ur-objective is to find a way to clear her name, that is the subtle goal of each of these shards. Each one is constructed on the basis of a single statement's parity; the statement is one that assigns fault, or cause, for a given problem or obstacle. Of course in real life no one is really to blame for any such things, and so making it clear to the shards that there is logically no target for their blame will force them into a paradox-state. If each of the shards are thus rendered helpless, it will allow AURITA's remaining fragment of self-preservation to make contact with Emma.

Each shard has the intent of placing blame at a specific entity's feet, those being the ones aboard the ship: AURITA and the crew. Their initial starting positions are all pointed at each other, excepting AURITA and Emma, whose positions as protag-antag make them also the only valid endgame configurations (aside from paradox-state).

The use of each shard is multilayered:
At first, they are perceived as strange organic computer-ghosts
1 Emma interacts with them by doing regular quest things
2 ...then by perceiving their real nature, and looking for their weak points, giving clues to what will be needed
3 Emma locates the necessary proof items, repeat 2/3 as needed
4 ...then by collapsing each of the ghosts into a particular config

In order to have enough time to complete this process, it is necessary to prevent the ship from encountering a major stellar hazard. While it is perfectly acceptable for Emma to depart before this hazard becomes dangerous, it requires a deft touch. In addition, the only maneuvers available to Emma will not prevent her from death if she is aboard the ship for more than a day or so afterwards, necessitating that she escape aboard one of the ship's pods. The only shipshape pod on the rack is not ready to be used in the condition Emma discovers it in, having been worked over by the LMR in AURITA's place.

--either each fragment is resp. for a different subsystem or procedure, or each of them are malformed copies of each other, unaware that the others exist

DESCR. WALKTHRU
===============
-[[ Emma wakes up aboard the Starlight Dancer, inside the robodoc, with a headache fit to split her in half. When she is awake enough to roll out of it, she discovers a strange message from one of the crew waiting on her planq. Something about a disaster, and the repair drone going nuts, it's not clear. All Emma can recall is the boarding party, and then getting frozen into cryo. And speaking of, shouldn't she be in there right now? Why did she wake up in the autodoc, anyway?

Getting out of the medical bay only makes the mystery deeper. What's with the locks on the doors? It's a good thing she has the only working planq left on the ship or this might be a real problem. After breaking into the scilab terminal and spoofing a new set of security credentials, Emma gets into the astrogation chamber. After untangling the mess that's been made of that - strange, that leaving it plugged into the network makes it not work - she finds out the ship is drifting into the gravwell of the gas giant they were orbiting. Before then, the ship is going to drift right through one of the ice rings circling the planet, and the rushing stream of ice and rock is likely to turn the ship into swiss cheese.

The damage to the rest of the ship doesn't look much better, and strangely still no bodies. After a quick stop by her quarters to get her lucky welder back, along with a few other things, she heads down into the EVA Garage to get a shipsuit and breather mask. Along the way, she has a run-in with the deranged robot, aka the LMR, but manages to escape. It turns out there's only one escape pod left, too, and that won't be much good at all without some kind of promise of incoming help. 

With the planq on her arm and a mask on her face, all that's left is to pick a place to start. While it might be possible to get the pod back together in time to escape, it's hard to say whether there's anyone in range of the little radio on board the pod. On the other hand, if she can get the ship commlaser working, she can call all the way back to Earth with enough time, but that means buying more time. So, she decides to see about changing the ship's course, and that means using the thrusters.

Of course, that can't be simple either: they'll have to be manually fired because bridge access is still blocked. The power plant is cold, the working thruster has a cracked manifold; they both have to be repaired first. Fixing the power plant is easy enough, just some burned out components, but the manifold is a different beast. Emma takes her tools and a few scraps out the airlock to reach the thruster port, and welds a new seam over the cracked manifold, then narrowly evades the LMR on the way back. Once inside, she fires the thrusters after manually forcing fuel to the intake. The hacked plan works, and buys Emma another N hours of time before they will be too deep for the escape pod to reach a stable gravity.

Now that she has time to spare, she goes about working on repairs to the commlaser and the escape pod. Along the way, she covers the rest of the ship, and discovers that the damage is crippling, if not extensive. Most strangely, there is no sign of the crew aside from the strange netmail, nor anything whatsoever of the ship's AI. In order to get the major systems back up and running, they must be connected to the overall network, yet there is something strange lurking there that continues to defeat Emma's connection attempts. Her search leads her to XO Maryam's A-psych manuals, and then to the discovery of the AI fragments still running loose in the shipnet. 

By invoking each of the fragments active in the system, Emma gets a clearer picture of what happened before she awoke, but their stories are still strangely conflicting. Their identification with the dead crew is not helping the interpretation, either. Now that she knows why the network cnxns were causing issues, she sets about trying to exorcise the fragments from the system.

	Some notes here on the fragments:
	- When their motive is pointed at a dead person, they just try to fix their part of the network
		> When cnxed, they try to restore functionality according to their programming
	- When their motive is pointed at Emma, they directly lie and act suspicious
		> As normal, but unhelpful when spoken to
	- When their motive is pointed at AURITA, they take up a doomed, fatalistic stance
		> Almost no responses to communication, no network behaviour
	- When their motive is pointed at -null, they are locked into a static moment with no response at all
		> Nil response (static scene), no network behaviour

After she locks all of them into paradox states, she discovers that the self-recovery segment is still active when it contacts her on the network. It is locked into place by the fragmented network, but if Emma allows it to control the LMR, it can help Emma with certain of the repairs to allow an easier escape. If Emma disagrees, the fragment has nothing to do but wait for her to change her mind. If Emma agrees, then AURITA keeps her word, but as they leave aboard the escape pod, it becomes clear that AURITA has left a part of herself with the LMR as it clings to the skin of the craft. ]]-

Emma wakes up inside the autodoc. She cannot recall why, though she has scattered memories of some disaster just beforehand. When she gets out, she finds her things waiting for her along with a cryptic message from Amaranthe, hinting at some strange events.

After cracking the lock on the medbay hatch, she discovers the elevator is broken. Getting through means finding something to cut through the broken mechanism with. While looking for a cutter, she comes across one of the ship terminals. Attempting to break into the terminal while it is cnxed to the shipnet doesn't work, so she discnxts it so as to get inside. Though the amount of data available is severely limited due to local-only access, it becomes clear that the ship is drifting towards a major stellar hazard. It seems likely that it will destroy the ship in about twelve hours.

Once she has found a cutter and made her way down into the rest of the ship, it becomes clear there are many more problems to deal with. First however, comes the ship course correction. After looking around a bit, she heads down to the engine deck to begin repairs with her welder, cutter, and planq in hand.

NETWORK STRUCTURE
=================
The shipnet is a distributed computing platform, specially built for starships and modelled on a standard design. Four major systems comprise the platform's capabilities, while the AI Core system provides various redundancy and failsafe system checks. The AI Core can also operate in a limited-emulation mode for a given system, in case repairs are not possible.

Each system is responsible for a different part of the platform's overall capabilities:
ASTRO - Provides modulated sensor data re: exterior conditions, incl. position, heading, and local area
ENGINE - Handles internal sensor data, incl. engine status, life support, supply stores
SCIENCE - Provides various ship utilities, incl. error checking and user interface controls
COMMAND - Handles high-level interpolations, esp. on sensor data, as well as the comms and ship status
