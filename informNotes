initial appearance != item's description, see WwI 3.11
The initial appearance should be used to describe the object when the player /first sees it in the game world/, right up until the player picks it up (the "handled" property). When picked up and x'd, I7 uses the item's description; if dropped and encountered later, it will simply list the item as normal with everything else in the room.
