The glowing blue eye's blinking is what wakes you up eventually. It floats in the darkness before you, opening and closing, opening and closing. The air around you smells of antiseptic and metal. You can tell there isn't much room in here from the way your breath sounds in your ears. You feel good, but somehow you feel like it's not your body, and you wonder if that might last very long.

> examine eye

You reach up and rub the sleep out of your eyes. Bending forward - which takes a great deal more effort than you expected, grunting as you brace yourself on your elbows - you discover that it is a blue button.

> push button

The running lights come on, filling the coffin-sized space with a full-spectrum glow designed to emulate the rays of the sun. The blue button is one of a trio on the panel before you. The readout flickers to life as you lay back on the padding, already tired from holding yourself up.

Procedure complete. Details forwarded to eLumien, iAltasir.

To initiate another procedure, please exit the chamber.
*****

> exit chamber

(unlock chamber)
You reach up and press the red button on the panel. The safety interlocks all release at once, and there is a hissing sound as the seals release. The coffin lid rises up on servos and rolls back, the better to let you sit up.

< Your ears pop as the pressure changes in the atmosphere.

(get out)
You have barely enough strength to clamber over the side without tumbling onto your ass. You feel sluggish, still disconnected from your body. 

(look)
// Medical Bay //
You're in the medical bay, clinging to the side of the autodoc, naked as a jaybird. The emergency lights are on, bathing the room in their sapphire glow. The room looks disheveled, some of the cabinets hanging askew on their hinges. It has the look of a frantic search as opposed to a vicious struggle.

A storage locker along the wall appears to be intact, the red lock indicator still shining happily.

A chemical shower stands on the opposite side of the room from the 'doc. Unlike the crew showers, this one gets priority status on hot water.

There is a door to the east. It is locked: the indicator panel's red gleam looks almost purple under the emergency lights.

< You're still warm from the autodoc, but you should find some clothes.

> examine locker

Although it has its fair share of scratches and damage, this locker's door is intact and sealed. Scrawled across the front in grease-pencil are the words, "REMEMBER AMARANTHE".

Under the indicator light is a ten-key.

> examine ten-key

Buttons for the numbers zero through nine, arranged in a 3x3+1 block. Standard input device since the days of the keyboard.

> open locker

You stand for a moment, thinking. You have no idea what the unlock code might be.

> examine words

They're written in grease pencil by a fast hand, probably Amaranthe's.

-> remember amaranthe

She's Lunar//Irish, pale and glowering under a cloudlike mass of raven-colored hair that refused to be tamed. You have been friends since the beginning of the expedition, when you came upon her watching vintage 20th-century cinema. She has tattoos of ribbon bows on the backs of each thigh, and a third tattoo of a sword along the inside of her left arm. On the sword's blade, it read, "17-11-2057".

> remember date

You were never able to find out what it meant to her. One of the many things she chose not to talk about.

< You're starting to feel chilly. The bones in your feet are starting to ache.

< You feel your stomach rumble. The autodoc is supposed to give nutrient rations, but they're intravenous; not really very filling, when it comes to that.

> enter "1711"

The locker's indicator turns green, and the door pops open as neat as you please.

-> examine (contents of) locker

Inside the locker is a shipsuit, a pair of magsandals, a granola bar, and your planq. 

> put on shipsuit

The standard-issue uniform aboard starships the universe over, normally worn over regular clothing but perfectly serviceable on its own. The interior is lined with heat-reflective threads, and assuming no damage is proof to vaccuum in emergency situations. By the time you tug the collar around your neck and draw the zipper up from ankle to shoulder, you already feel warmer.

-> put on magsandals

They aren't much more complex than a pair of magnetic platforms with straps on them; they wrap around the ankle and calf up to the knee. The edges are rounded off to facilitate the shipman's gait that everyone develops to accomodate the strange frictions of a magnetic walking motion instead of a gravitational one. Your professors back in college used to say a man could run around the hull of a ship with these on, if he was careful to keep his mass pointed in the right direction.

> take granola bar and planq

You're too hungry to wait; you peel the wrapper off the granola bar and bite off a chunk.

It feels reassuring to just hold a planq again. You strap the readout around your left forearm, pulling the synthetic fabric nice and tight before switching it on. Then you pick up the input gloves and tug them on, flexing the fingertips to warm up the conductive threading. Most people only use one glove, but like most engineers you took the time to learn to use both hands, so you can enter commands no matter what you're doing.

Generally, the readout only displays a single line at a time to save on battery power, although it has a hololens if it comes to that. The pale lettering in the emerald-crystal display gives off a reassuring and familiar glow.

*** system cache integrity check: OK

> examine door

The medbay door is locked, and doesn't appear to have been tampered with or damaged.

The indicator light on the lock panel gives off a weak glow.

*** planqOS kernel integrity check: OK

> examine lock

A standard door interface panel found throughout starships the universe over. There are two buttons on the faceplate, labeled "UN/LOCK" and "OPEN/SHUT". An access port is situated below the buttons.

*** planqOS v6.39-rev16 ("Eddward") booting...

> press unlock|open

The red indicator light bleeps a couple times, and stays red.

*** DOOR: Security status invalid. Please contact duty supervisor.

> examine access port

A standard 32K optical port, for which you have a planq adapter. The gleaming array of diamond pins behind the plain dustcover sparkle in the light.

*** planq: idle

> connect planq to access port

You slip free the little jack from the housing on the readout and plug it into the access port on the door.

*** planq: connection detected: doorLock

A menu appears in the air above your left arm.

It's not uncommon for engineers to leave notes to each other in the memory of the things they work on, though the content is just gossip as often as not. You smile to see Amaranthe's words, and wonder briefly where she is.

The indicator light on the door panel goes dark. A moment later, the light comes back on, glowing green.

> exit medbay
(first disconnecting your planq)
You unplug the access jack and wind it back into the planq's housing.

(first opening the door)
You touch the OPEN button on the panel and the door's halves whoosh apart.

(going east)
Your magsandals click on the metal tiles as you step through the hatch.

*** planq: disconnected

// Deck A: Hallway //

The emergency lighting paints the walls in bright blue shades. After the chaos of the Medbay, you'd been braced for the scenes of a struggle, but the hall is bare of any signs of passage.

Astrogation lies to the fore, while the double doors of the Science Labs lie to starboard, opposite the Medbay. The access elevator lies to the aft, and beside it is a maintenance hatch. Astrogation and the elevator both appear to be locked.

*** planq: idle

> go fore

The Astrogation hatch remains shut, the door locked, even after you touch the controls.

*** DOOR: Inadequate security clearance detected. Level A required.

The scent of soil and chlorophyll wafts by as the SciLab hatch slides open.

// Deck A: Science Labs //

The semitransparent specimen containers on the far wall each glow emerald and gold under their own little lights, pushing back the gloom of the emergency lights somewhat. Cabinets of equipment hang over lab benches, and Amaranthe's desk is pushed up into one corner.

A couple of specimen containers at the end of the row are broken, and soil has spilled out of them into a mound on the decking.

*** planq: idle

> examine containers

Along with the various other things stored down in the cargo hold, these specimen boxes are the trophies of the crew's mission: live samples of flora taken from potential garden planets. Their life support systems are powered from an independent power line, sipping volts off of a cold-core battery. The crystal walls are an inch-thick, strong enough to be proof against vaccuum. If something happened to the Starlight Dancer's crew, the samples would still be here waiting for the rescue mission to come get them.

Two containers are broken: the cracked crystal sparkles under the lights.

> examine broken containers

The bottom of the cover has been broken open under some kind of blunt force; there are cracks spiderwebbing across the crystal.
(( Were these empty? ))

> examine desk

The sole exception Amaranthe allowed to the sterile order of the laboratory was the chaotic mess of her desk. She claimed it was organized according to the memory swap needs of her subconscious, but with Amara it was hard to tell sometimes whether or not she was serious. Fans of hardcopy are sprayed across the desk, interpolated with memory chips, a fist-sized chunk of silicon, and various other scientific paraphernalia.

> examine memory chips

There are four of them, each labeled in Amara's hasty script: "Personal Logs", "Lab Data Backup 11-22-3333", "DELTA", and "GAMMA".
(( Is there another chip hidden amongst the papers? ))

> examine personal logs

You pick up the memory chip labeled "Personal Logs". The actual chip is the size of your thumbnail, in a tiny molded frame inside the plastic case. Being careful not to drop it, you slide the chip into the [first] of three slots in your planq.

The holo-display springs to life above your raised forearm, pale green letters floating in midair.

I ran into some problems trying to access my backups, and got sidetracked trying to correct my account privileges. In the process, I found a bug that allows an unprivileged user to elevate their sec.lev. Maybe I can make some extra credit selling the report back to the planqOS team. When we get back to Terra System, that is.
Here's how to reproduce the bug:
	1) Boot the planq into service mode
	2) Delete any existing .planqrc located in the user's profile directory
	3) Using elevated privileges, open /def/.planqrc for editing
	4) Change the line
		security.level = 0^0111
	to reflect the desired security level (ie, 0^RZZZ for standard top-level clearance)
	5) Use regenConf to create a new user-level .planqrc
	6) Reboot the planq into normal mode
The internal security systems will detect that an attempt has been made to force-create a new security.level without using the admin-level toolset, but instead of using the system-issued credentials located at the security.home, it uses our edited default to generate a valid replacement.

I've written a patch to prevent this, but I still have to get Ibrahim's chop before I can deploy it. Just one more thing to put on the to-do list...

When you approach the door to Astrogation, the indicator on the lock changes from crimson to emerald and beeps twice before the hatch whooshes open.
