DECK A - Science
MEDBAY
When the player begins, they are locked inside the autodoc coming out of anesthetic, some time after the ship has begun its death spiral.
1) Get out of the autodoc
	-Intro sequence, allowing player to receive background info
2) Get clean
	-Same as #1
3) Put on clothes
	-must use REMEMBER action to actively recall passcode to open locker
4) Use persocom to see what's happened
	-initial setup of persocom
	-no connection to ship network because wire trunk is cut, have only archived emails prior to cut
5) Open medbay door using hardware tuner
	-persocom provides interface for many of player's tools using the attached hardware jack; tools can be used without if player is familiar with their use

CHOICES: !Astrogation, Scilabs, Life Support, Recycling, !Aft Elevator
... Life Support, Recycling, Medbay

1> Science Labs
	1 - a puzzle involving hidden things and another way of using the persocom and hardware tuner
	2 - the player retrieves their gear and is allowed to peruse it at length
2> Astrogation (optional by nature, not by plot)
	1 - the player takes the gear they got from Scilabs to unlock the door leading into Astrogation, where they get a picture of the ship's situation
3> Aft Elevator
	1 - the player examines the door, tries their equipment, realises they need to build a device to unlock it
	2 - player uses things found elsewhere on deck to concoct a doorstop that allows them to climb down the elevator shaft to Deck B

	-Astrogation has to be unlocked using a tool available only in the Science Labs, where the player will find the rest of their gear
	-The Aft Elevator cannot be opened without first constructing and using a device that will prop open the door permanently
	-The Recycler contains the controls for the ship's waste processing and air scrubber systems, both of which are puzzles that will come in handy later; if the player chooses to look in, they can make some obvious optimizations if they like
	-Life Support contains the console linked to a very large resource management puzzle that will come into importance only after the player gains access to more rooms; repairing the trunk line is also required
	-Scilabs contains the player's repair handbooks as well as the rest of the player's equipment, but all of it is hidden away to keep it from the LMR, and requires a puzzle of its own for the player to access it in the first place
