Silent Stars
An Interactive Fiction by Zaq Grow
Release 1 / Serial number 130430 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Antiseptic Coffin, in dim light
You&apos;re lying down inside a metal coffin that isn&apos;t much larger than you. It (you?) reeks of medical disinfectants; the fuzziness in your head feels like it&apos;s keeping away a headache from all the fumes.

A small plastex hatch window is set into the hatch above you.

A flashing red button on the control panel above you casts flickering shadows.

Medical Bay, in dim light
You make a splash instead of a thud when you land. As you raise your {{drug-addled}} head to look, you choke down the urge to vomit as you realize the syrupy black gunk coating your arms up to the bicep is half-dried blood. The puddle is almost ankle-deep and wall-to-wall.

 {{&quot;Disarray&quot; is putting it mildly:}} every single cabinet in the room is open and empty. Some of the doors have been torn off the hinges and lie mangled in a corner. The grey tile floor is littered with broken glass, bits of medical paraphernalia, and dried blood.

The dark hulk of the autodoc crouches in one corner.

A green vinyl curtain is drawn across the entrance to a small chemical shower.

A bank of gear lockers along one wall have received a similar treatment as the cabinets.

One of the gear lockers is still intact; the controls glow red.

A giant pile of debris lies more or less in the corner.

The floor is ankle-deep in blood. It gurgles and sloshes as you move about. You try not to move around too much.

A bit of steel mesh has been set into the middle of the tile floor. Something seems to be blocking the flow.

Against the wall, tucked fetal into the corner, lies a corpse wearing a shipsuit. If it weren&apos;t for the shipsuit, you&apos;d never know it was a corpse in the first place.

The emergency lightstrip reveals a medical hatch.

The smell of burning electronics hits your lizard hindbrain like a rivet gun and you awaken almost immediately, limbs flailing against the sides of the coffin. A badly-milled bolt opens a bloody streak on the back of your wrist, and several seconds pass before you realize you can&apos;t feel it because you&apos;re completely numb.

 ...

 The smoke smell drifts by your nose again, a little stronger. You startle and bark your forehead on the plastex window above you. The pain keeps you awake this time.
