    <result xml:space="preserve">The smell of burning electronics hits your lizard hindbrain like a rivet gun and you awaken almost immediately, limbs flailing against the sides of the coffin. A badly-milled bolt opens a bloody streak on the back of your wrist, and several seconds pass before you realize you can't feel it because you're completely numb.&#x000A; ...&#x000A; The smoke smell drifts by your nose again, a little stronger. You startle and bark your forehead on the plastex window above you. The pain keeps you awake this time.&#x000A;&#x000A;Silent Stars&#x000A;An Interactive Fiction by Zaq Grow&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 130326 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;Silk curtains, dark wood cabinets, matte grey hardware: you're in the kitchen of your family home. No matter how much time you spend in your workshop or the little office in the hut out back, this is where you truly feel you're at rest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thin handwoven silk curtains shroud a couple of blurred shapes moving around the yard outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;A gas range, showpiece of the kitchen and the center of your food obsessions, claims center stage in the middle of the kitchen island. A bright red teapot rests on the stove. The flame under the burner is lit.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
