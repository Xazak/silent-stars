Silent Stars
An Interactive Fiction by Zaq Grow
Release 1 / Serial number 130513 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Antiseptic Coffin, in dim light
You&apos;re lying down inside a metal coffin that isn&apos;t much larger than you. It (you?) reeks of medical disinfectants; the fuzziness in your head feels like it&apos;s keeping away a headache from all the fumes.

A small plastex hatch window is set into the hatch above you.

A flashing red button on the control panel above you casts flickering shadows.

Medical Bay, in dim light
You make a splash instead of a thud when you land. As you raise your {{drug-addled}} head to look, you choke down the urge to vomit as you realize the syrupy black gunk coating your arms up to the bicep is half-dried blood. The puddle is almost ankle-deep and wall-to-wall.

 {{&quot;Disarray&quot; is putting it mildly:}} every single cabinet in the room is open and empty. Some of the doors have been torn off the hinges and lie mangled in a corner. The grey tile floor is littered with broken glass, bits of medical paraphernalia, and dried blood.

The dark hulk of the autodoc crouches in one corner.

A green vinyl curtain is drawn across the entrance to a small chemical shower.

A bank of gear lockers along one wall have received a similar treatment as the cabinets.

One of the gear lockers is still intact; the controls glow red.

A giant pile of debris lies more or less in the corner.

The floor is ankle-deep in blood. It gurgles and sloshes as you move about. You try not to move around too much.

Against the wall, tucked fetal into the corner, lies a corpse wearing a shipsuit. If it weren&apos;t for the shipsuit, you&apos;d never know it was a corpse in the first place.

The emergency lightstrip limns the medbay door.

The syrupy ichor gurgles and splashes partway up your calf as you move through the room.

The smell of burning electronics hits your lizard hindbrain like a rivet gun and you awaken almost immediately, limbs flailing against the sides of the coffin. A badly-milled bolt opens a bloody streak on the back of your wrist, and several seconds pass before you realize you can&apos;t feel it because you&apos;re completely numb.

 ...

 The smoke smell drifts by your nose again, a little stronger. You startle and bark your forehead on the plastex window above you. The pain keeps you awake this time.

Antiseptic Coffin, in dim light
You&apos;re lying down inside a metal coffin that isn&apos;t much larger than you. It (you?) reeks of medical disinfectants; the fuzziness in your head feels like it&apos;s keeping away a headache from all the fumes.
