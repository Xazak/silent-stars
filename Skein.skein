The smell of burning electronics hits your lizard hindbrain like a rivet gun and you awaken almost immediately, limbs flailing against the sides of the coffin. A badly-milled bolt opens a bloody streak on the back of your wrist, and several seconds pass before you realize you can&apos;t feel it because you&apos;re completely numb.
 ...
 The smoke smell drifts by your nose again, a little stronger. You startle and bark your forehead on the plastex window above you. The pain keeps you awake this time.

Silent Stars
An Interactive Fiction by Zaq Grow
Release 1 / Serial number 130327 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Kitchen
Silk curtains, dark wood cabinets, matte grey hardware: you&apos;re in the kitchen of your family home. No matter how much time you spend in your workshop or the little office in the hut out back, this is where you truly feel you&apos;re at rest.

Thin handwoven silk curtains shroud a couple of blurred shapes moving around the yard outside.

A gas range, showpiece of the kitchen and the center of your food obsessions, claims center stage in the middle of the kitchen island. A bright red teapot rests on the stove. The flame under the burner is lit.

Max chops vegetables.

Outside, you can see your son Victor playing in the garden with the neighbor boy. They&apos;re pretending to be soldiers, creeping around and through the plants on belly and forearms, evading imaginary machine-gun fire.

A small plastex window is set into the hatch above you.

The control panel above you shows a blinking red button.
