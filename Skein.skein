Silent Stars
An Interactive Fiction by Zaq Grow
Release 1 / Serial number 130418 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Antiseptic Coffin, in dim light
You&apos;re lying down inside a metal coffin that isn&apos;t much larger than you. It (you?) reeks of medical disinfectants; the fuzziness in your head feels like it&apos;s keeping away a headache from all the fumes.

A small plastex hatch window is set into the hatch above you.

A flashing red button on the control panel above you casts flickering shadows.

The smell of burning electronics hits your lizard hindbrain like a rivet gun and you awaken almost immediately, limbs flailing against the sides of the coffin. A badly-milled bolt opens a bloody streak on the back of your wrist, and several seconds pass before you realize you can&apos;t feel it because you&apos;re completely numb.

 ...

 The smoke smell drifts by your nose again, a little stronger. You startle and bark your forehead on the plastex window above you. The pain keeps you awake this time.
