WIN CONDITIONS:
- Emma MUST flee in the escape craft before the ship is destroyed
	- Emma MUST repair the craft

? How did Emma choose to resolve the situation with AURITA?
	-- Only the 'worst' option is available if the ship's drift is not corrected
	IGNORE - AURITA probably gets to blow up the escape pod with Emma in it
	NEGOTIATE - Emma and AURITA bargain for Emma's life
	DISABLE - Emma cuts off all of AURITA's core cnxns
	DESTROY - Emma destroys AURITA's AI core (perhaps via LMR)
	INTEGRATE - Emma uses Maryam's information to collapse AURITA's chaotic personality matrix
		...causes the partitioned sections of AURITA's core to be overwritten
		vs. Emma - All of AURITA's motives are set to "kill player"
		vs. AURITA - All of AURITA's motives are set to "kill self"
		vs. null - Paradox state allows open communication with remaining intact fragment of AURITA's core

=====
DANGER: If the ship is not moved to a safe orbit within ???? hours, it will drift into a planetary ring, where micrometeorites will turn the ship into swiss cheese!
	Solutions:
	CHEAP-FAST: Detonate remainder of fuel to divert ship
		1) Reinforce tank to provide correct thrust
		2) Install detonation device
		3) Detonate and hope you do not die
	FAST-SOLID: Repair the maneuvering jets to push the ship
		1) Fix a majority of the attitude jets
		2) Prime the jets for ignition
		3) Issue nav commands at Astro/Bridge terminal
	SOLID-CHEAP: Manually fire the thruster to move the ship
		1) Allow the power plant to reach operating capacity
		2) Confirm fuel path is intact and controls operative
		3) Prime the thruster and allow it to warm up
		4) Ignite, let run, and shutdown the thruster engine from Astro

DANGER: The LMR's subverted programming means that if it catches Emma in the open, it will reduce her to cooked ashes
	Solutions:
	AVOID: Emma can hear it coming because it emits a distinctive sound as it moves
	DECEIVE: The LMR's sensors are damaged: it can be hidden from, or lured with bait
	SUBVERT: If Emma can gain access to its controls, she can reprogram it to do certain other things
	DISABLE: It can be disabled in software or via [a very bright flash of light]
	DESTROY: It can be told to self-destruct or lured into a suitable trap

DANGER: AURITA, the ship AI, has gone crazy: she will try to use misdirection and sabotage to destroy the ship and all the evidence before Emma can escape
	Solutions:
	IGNORE: Emma disregards AURITA's attacks by working around them
	NEGOTIATE: Emma and AURITA bargain for Emma's life
	! Solutions beyond here REQUIRE more time than is allowed without fixing the ship drift!
	DISABLE: Emma cuts off all of AURITA's core cnxns
	DESTROY: Emma destroys AURITA's AI core (perhaps via LMR)
	INTEGRATE: Emma uses Maryam's information to collapse AURITA's chaotic personality matrix
		...causes the partitioned sections of AURITA's core to be overwritten
		vs. Emma - All of AURITA's motives are set to "kill player"
		vs. AURITA - All of AURITA's motives are set to "kill self"
		vs. null - Paradox state allows open communication with remaining intact fragment of AURITA's core

DANGER: The escape pod took some damage in all of the chaos and must be repaired before it can be used, whether she remains in orbit or opts to make planetfall
	Checklist:
		1) Air?
		2) Food/water?
		3) Fuel?
		4) Beacon?
